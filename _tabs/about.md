I am a Computer Science Engineer. My current focus lies in the
infrastructure, where I specialize in manage, monitor and trou-
bleshoot both on-premises and cloud environments.
I am particularly intrigued by the vast possibilities that cloud com-
puting offers, and I am actively expanding my knowledge in this
area. Committed to staying at the forefront of technological ad-
vancements, I am dedicated to continuous learning and leveraging
my skills to contribute to innovative projects.
